# PhasePlate — Changes Log

## 2026-07-01 — Anticipatory ad placement

Implements VISION.md's Advertising Strategy: "surface the right product at the right moment in her cycle before she's in need — not after."

### New
- **`src/utils/anticipatoryAds.ts`** — `getActiveAd(quadrant, currentPhase, contraception?)`. House/placeholder content per quadrant (no real ad network account exists yet — this is the anticipatory-*timing* engine, swap `AD_CONTENT` for real sponsored placements once one is set up): pain relief + period products anticipating menstrual (Menstruation, 2-day window); sleep/energy supplements + spa anticipating luteal (Sleep, 2-day window); iron + grocery delivery anticipating luteal (Nutrition, 3-day window, matching the existing "increase iron over the next 3 days" nutrition-tip copy); topical/recovery products anticipating menstrual (Physical, 2-day window). Determines "the phase immediately preceding the target phase" per contraception type (hormonal collapses ovulatory) so the window computes correctly whether or not ovulatory occurs. Deliberately returns `null` once the target phase itself has arrived — VISION.md is explicit that this is anticipatory, not reactive ("Midol before cramping begins — not during"). 6 unit tests.
- **`src/components/AnticipatoryAdCard.tsx`** — small "Suggested for you" card, same visual weight as the existing phase-aware hint banners, no fake CTA button (no real affiliate/purchase link exists to point it at).
- **`isHormonalContraception()`** exported from `cycleCalculator.ts` (previously a private `HORMONAL_TYPES` check) so the ad logic and the phase calculator share one source of truth.
- Wired into all 4 quadrant screens: MenstruationScreen, SleepScreen, NutritionScreen, PhysicalScreen. Sleep and Physical didn't previously read `CycleContext` — added.

### Deferred (not built)
- **"Localized class ads"** (VISION.md Physical Wellness section — "the classes find them") is a different mechanism (location-based business discovery), not cycle-anticipatory logic. Out of scope for this pass.
- Actual ad network integration (a real account, ad unit IDs, iOS App Tracking Transparency prompt) — everything here is house/placeholder content.

---

## 2026-07-01 — Consent wall (forced scroll + dual checkbox)

Implements VISION.md's Legal/Consent section: a linear, unbypassable flow that must complete before any app content is reachable.

### New
- **`src/screens/Consent/ConsentScreen.tsx`** — full-screen (not a dismissible Modal) gate. Scrollable legal text; "Accept & Continue" stays disabled until the user has scrolled to the bottom **and** checked both boxes ("General Terms of Service" and "Confidentiality Notice" separately — the deliberate dual-checkbox "psychological speed bump" from VISION.md). Handles the edge case where the text fits on screen without scrolling (large tablet) by comparing content height to viewport height on layout, rather than relying solely on `onScroll` firing.
- **`src/screens/Consent/legalText.ts`** — **placeholder legal text only, not reviewed by a lawyer.** Must be replaced with the real General Terms of Service and Confidentiality Notice before public launch.
- **`consent_records` table** (`supabase_setup.sql`) — audit trail per user + terms version (`general_terms_accepted`, `confidentiality_accepted`, `accepted_at`), not just a local on-device flag, so there's an actual record if the consent flow is ever legally challenged. RLS scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id`, same pattern as every other table in this project.
- **`fetchConsentStatus()` / `saveConsentAcceptance()`** (`supabase.ts`) — `CURRENT_TERMS_VERSION` constant; bumping it forces every user (even ones who already accepted an older version) to see the wall again.
- **App.tsx** — `bootstrap()` now checks consent status right after `ensureAnonSession()`. If not yet accepted, `ConsentScreen` is the *only* thing rendered — no `NavigationContainer`, no auth modal, nothing else mounted underneath, so there's no path around it.

### Verified
- Applied `consent_records` table to the live DB via the Supabase Management API.
- End-to-end tested against a real anonymous session: pre-consent read returns empty, insert succeeds, post-consent read returns the row. RLS confirmed scoping correctly. Test user and row deleted after.

## 2026-07-01 — Tighten analyze-meal to 1 free call/day + surface real error messages

### Changed
- **`analyze-meal/index.ts`** — `DAILY_CALL_LIMIT` lowered from 20 to 1. Photo nutrition logging is a free-tier feature per VISION.md's pricing table, so this caps the free daily allotment; it isn't a subscription-tier gate.
- **`NutritionScreen.tsx`** — `analysePhoto()` now unwraps `FunctionsHttpError.context` (the raw Response) to read the actual JSON error body. Previously any non-2xx response (429 daily limit, 413 oversized image, 502 OpenAI failure) surfaced supabase-js's generic "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" instead of the real message — meant users would never actually see "come back tomorrow" once the limit dropped to 1/day.

### Verified
- Redeployed; confirmed live with a real anonymous session: 1st call succeeds (200), 2nd same-day call from the same user rejected (429, "Daily meal analysis limit reached. Try again tomorrow."). Test user and usage row cleaned up after.

---

## 2026-07-01 — Referral flag + physician PDF export

Implements the VISION.md Medical Guidance Philosophy: the app never diagnoses, but flags recurring patterns worth a doctor visit and can hand over an objective, disclaimer-headed log for that appointment.

### New
- **`src/utils/referralFlag.ts`** — `detectReferralFlags()`. Tracks three symptom types against `menstruation_logs`: severe cramps (`cramp_level >= 4`), low mood (`bad`/`terrible`), heavy flow (`heavy`/`very_heavy`). For each log, computes which cycle phase it fell in (via `calculateCyclePhase` with that log's own date) and counts occurrences within the user's *current* phase across all fetched history — this cross-cycle counting is what makes it "Infradian Logic" pattern detection rather than a single-cycle coincidence. Triggers at 3+ occurrences per VISION.md's spec. Each flag carries the exact "Infradian Logic Observation" alert copy and a suggested-labs list (cramp → Vitamin D, mood → TSH, flow → Full Iron Panel). 5 unit tests in `src/__tests__/referralFlag.test.ts`.
- **`src/utils/physicianExport.ts`** — `exportPhysicianSummary()`. Builds an HTML report (disclaimer header verbatim from VISION.md, suggested-labs section, chronological symptom table) and hands it to `expo-print`'s `printToFileAsync` then `expo-sharing`'s `shareAsync` so the user gets the native share sheet (Save to Files, AirDrop, Mail, Print, etc.) — no custom viewer needed.
- **`fetchLogsInRange()`** (`supabase.ts`) — arbitrary date-range log fetch, used by both the flag detector and the export (180-day window).
- **MenstruationScreen** — dismissible banner rendered per active flag, showing the alert copy with "Show me a summary" (triggers the PDF export for that flag) and "Not now" (session-only dismiss, not persisted).
- **ProfileScreen** — standalone "Physician Summary" row under MY CYCLE so users can generate the export anytime, not only when a flag fires.
- **Dependencies**: `expo-print`, `expo-sharing`.

### Notes
- Contraception type isn't threaded through cycle phase calculation here, matching how MenstruationScreen/ProfileScreen already call `calculateCyclePhase` elsewhere in the app (defaults to `'none'`).
- Flag dismissal is per-session component state only — reappears next visit if the underlying pattern still holds. No persisted "don't show again" yet.

---

## 2026-07-01 — Security pass on analyze-meal (rate limiting + payload cap)

Reviewed the `analyze-meal` Edge Function now that it's live in production. `verify_jwt: true` only confirms the caller holds *a* valid Supabase JWT — the public anon key itself qualifies, and both it and the function URL are extractable from any shipped app bundle. Without a cap, anyone could call it in a loop and bill the project's OpenAI account indefinitely.

### New
- **`analyze_meal_usage` table + `increment_analyze_meal_usage()` RPC** (`supabase_setup.sql`) — atomic per-user daily call counter. No RLS policies defined on purpose: only the Edge Function's service-role client should ever touch it, never the app directly. Applied directly to the live DB via the Supabase Management API.

### Changed
- **`analyze-meal/index.ts`**:
  - Rejects `image` payloads over ~6MB raw (base64 length > 8,000,000) with `413` — guards against oversized repeated-request abuse.
  - Extracts `sub` (user id) from the caller's JWT (already signature-verified by the platform before invocation) and increments `analyze_meal_usage` via the service-role client; returns `429` past 20 calls/day for that user. DB tracking failures fail open (logged, request still proceeds) rather than blocking legitimate use on a transient outage.
  - OpenAI error responses no longer echo raw upstream error text to the client — logged server-side, generic message returned instead.
- Redeployed and verified live: oversized payload → `413`; real anonymous-session call → `200` with `analyze_meal_usage` row incremented to `1`; test user and row deleted after verification.

## 2026-07-01 — Android Health Connect migration

### New
- **`react-native-health-connect@3.5.3`** — replaces `react-native-google-fit` (broken since Google Fit sunset June 2025, was returning nulls for all Android health stats).
- **`expo-build-properties`** — added to plugins to raise Android `compileSdkVersion`/`targetSdkVersion` to 35 and `minSdkVersion` to 26 (required by Health Connect).

### Changed
- **`healthKitService.ts`** — `fetchAndroidStats()` rewritten: `initialize()` → `readRecords('Steps'|'ActiveCaloriesBurned'|'RestingHeartRate'|'ExerciseSession', { timeRangeFilter })`. Steps summed from records in range; calories summed via `energy.inKilocalories`; resting HR takes the most recent sample; last workout derived from the most recent `ExerciseSession` record (title + computed duration from start/end time). `requestHealthPermissions()` Android branch now calls `HealthConnect.initialize()` + `requestPermission()` with `Steps`/`ActiveCaloriesBurned`/`RestingHeartRate`/`ExerciseSession` read scopes. `HealthStats` interface and iOS path unchanged — `fetchTodayStats()` still returns the same shape on both platforms.
- **`app.config.js`** — added `android.permissions` entries for `android.permission.health.READ_STEPS`, `READ_ACTIVE_CALORIES_BURNED`, `READ_HEART_RATE`, `READ_EXERCISE`. Added `react-native-health-connect` (config plugin auto-detected via its `app.plugin.js`) and `expo-build-properties` to the `plugins` array.
- **`package.json`** — removed `react-native-google-fit`; doctor's `reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude` now lists `react-native-health` and `react-native-health-connect` instead.

### Notes
- Health Connect app must be installed on the user's Android device (part of the OS on Android 14+, a separate Play Store app before that).
- Native change — requires a new development/production Android build to take effect; not testable in Expo Go.
- Play Store submission needs Google's Health Connect [permissions declaration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LFjbq1MOCZySpP5eIVkoyzXTanpcGTYQH26lKcrQUJo/viewform) — approval + whitelist propagation can take 1–2 weeks combined. Not urgent since iOS is the launch priority, but must happen before Android goes live.

## 2026-07-01 — OpenAI key moved server-side (Supabase Edge Function)

### New
- **`supabase/functions/analyze-meal/index.ts`** — Deno Edge Function that proxies the GPT-4o Vision call. Accepts `{ image: base64 }`, returns the same `AnalysedFood` JSON shape the client expects.
- **`supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts`** — shared CORS headers helper for edge functions.

### Changed
- **`NutritionScreen.tsx`** — `analysePhoto()` now calls `supabase.functions.invoke('analyze-meal', { body: { image: base64 } })` instead of hitting `api.openai.com` directly. `OPENAI_KEY`/`EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` constant removed from the client.
- **`.env.local`** — `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` renamed to `OPENAI_API_KEY` (no `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix, so Expo no longer inlines it into the JS bundle). Value kept locally only so it can be copied into `supabase secrets set`.
- **`.env.local.example`** — removed the OpenAI key line entirely (no longer a client-side var).
- **`supabase_setup.sql`** — added deploy notes (`supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=...` then `supabase functions deploy analyze-meal`).
- **`tsconfig.json`** — excluded `supabase/functions` from the app's TS project (Deno runtime globals like `Deno.serve` aren't available in the RN/Expo type environment).

### Still needed (user tasks, not code)
- Run `supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=...` and `supabase functions deploy analyze-meal` (requires Supabase CLI installed + project linked — not available in this sandbox).
- Remove `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` from EAS Secrets dashboard (expo.dev → project → Secrets) since it's no longer read anywhere.
- New EAS build not required for this change alone — it's a pure JS/edge-function change, no native binary impact. Still bundled with the pending build for the other queued fixes.

## 2026-07-01 — Sleep history calendar + past-date entry

### New
- **Sleep history calendar** (`src/screens/Sleep/SleepScreen.tsx`) — replaced the 7-day list with a full monthly calendar. Days with logged sleep are colour-coded by quality (1 = coral red, 2 = warm orange, 3 = sky blue, 4 = medium blue, 5 = deep navy). When no quality rating is stored, colour falls back to sleep duration (<6h orange, 6-7.5h light blue, 7.5h+ medium blue). A five-swatch legend below the calendar explains the scale.
- **Past-date entry** — any past day on the calendar is tappable. Tapping selects the day and shows a summary card beneath the calendar. Tapping "Log Sleep" or "Edit Entry" on that card opens the full log sheet pre-filled with that day's existing data (or blank defaults for a new entry). Saves upsert to `log_date` = selected date, not hardcoded today. Future dates are blocked (`maxDate`).
- **Month navigation** — data loads per viewed month via the calendar's `onMonthChange` callback; navigating back/forward fetches the appropriate date range from `fetchSleepLogs`.

---

## 2026-07-01 — Paywall wired + theme.ts

### New
- **PaywallScreen wired into navigation** (`ProfileStackNavigator.tsx`, `ProfileScreen.tsx`, `types/index.ts`) — `Paywall` added to `ProfileStackParamList`; registered as a modal in `ProfileStackNavigator`; new SUBSCRIPTION section in Profile tab shows "Upgrade to Plus or Premium" row for free users (taps to Paywall modal) and active tier badge + "Manage Subscription" row for subscribers.
- **`src/utils/theme.ts`** — centralised colour tokens: brand, phase swatches/backgrounds/text, subscription tiers, neutrals, status. Available for import in new screens going forward.

---

## 2026-07-01 — Deep linking + calendar fix + crash guard

### New
- **Deep link handler** (`App.tsx`) — email confirmation links (`com.coulascreations.phaseplate://#access_token=...`) now open the app and complete the Supabase session upgrade automatically. Handles both cold start (`getInitialURL`) and warm start (`addEventListener`). `onAuthStateChange` then re-checks the onboarding profile and dismisses the auth modal.
- **URL scheme registered** (`app.config.js`) — `scheme: 'com.coulascreations.phaseplate'` added at the Expo top level. Android `intentFilters` added so the scheme opens the app on Android too.

### Fixed
- **Calendar blue dot** (`cycleCalendar.ts`, `MenstruationScreen.tsx`) — removed `marked: true` + `dots` which leaked the library's default blue dot on all calendar days in `markingType="custom"` mode. Logged period days now show a red `borderWidth: 2` ring via `customStyles` instead, which is visually clear alongside the phase tints.
- **White screen on launch** (`App.tsx`) — `bootstrap()` had no error handling; if `fetchOnboardingProfile()` threw for any reason, `setAuthReady(true)` never ran and the app was permanently stuck on a blank screen. Wrapped in `try/finally` so it always unblocks.

---

## 2026-07-01 — Sleep time drum picker + README

### Updated
- **Sleep time picker** (`src/screens/Sleep/SleepScreen.tsx`) — replaced 15-minute increment stepper buttons with a drum/wheel picker (iOS-native scroll feel). Bedtime and wake time each show a scrollable hour column (12-hour, snaps per item) and a scrollable minute column (0-59, per-minute precision). AM/PM toggles beside each picker. Drums auto-scroll to the correct position each time the sheet opens via `resetKey`. Zero TS errors, no new dependencies.

### Docs
- **README.md** — rewrote from placeholder. Now covers: project structure, all 5 Supabase tables, auth flow, env vars, how to run/build/submit, core cycle logic, RevenueCat setup, known issues, and key architectural decisions.

---

## 2026-06-30 — Sleep log v1 + cycle date calendar picker

### New
- **Sleep manual log** (`src/screens/Sleep/SleepScreen.tsx`) — replaces the placeholder. Shows today's sleep card (empty state or summary) with a "Log Sleep / Edit Today" button. Log sheet slides up from the bottom (same pattern as MenstruationScreen) with: bedtime stepper (12-hour AM/PM, 15-min increments), wake time stepper, calculated sleep hours display, quality rating 1-5, energy level chips (Sluggish / Low / Normal / High / Energized), optional notes. Upserts to a new `sleep_logs` table (UNIQUE on user_id, log_date). Shows a 7-day recent history list below.
- **`sleep_logs` Supabase table** — DDL added to `supabase.ts` comment block (run in SQL Editor). `saveSleepLog` and `fetchSleepLogs` functions added. `SleepLog` type and `EnergyLevel` union type exported.

### Updated
- **CycleSettingsScreen** (`src/screens/Profile/CycleSettingsScreen.tsx`) — "Last period started" row now expands an inline `Calendar` (from `react-native-calendars/src/calendar`) on tap. Future dates blocked via `maxDate`. Selecting a day closes the calendar and updates the date. Cycle and period length steppers unchanged.

---

## 2026-06-30 — User login & profile saving

### New
- **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) — wraps Supabase auth state; exposes `user`, `isAnonymous`, `loading` via `useAuth()` hook. Listens to `onAuthStateChange` for real-time session updates.
- **AuthScreen** (`src/screens/Auth/AuthScreen.tsx`) — email + password sign in / create account modal screen. Two-mode toggle (Create Account / Sign In). "Create Account" uses Supabase `updateUser` to upgrade the anonymous session to a real account, preserving all existing health data (logs, cycle settings, onboarding profile) under the same user_id. "Sign In" uses `signInWithPassword`. Branded in app rose (`#8B3A5A`).
- **Auth route in ProfileStackNavigator** — `Auth` screen added to `ProfileStackParamList`; navigates as modal from Profile tab.
- **Account section in ProfileScreen** — new ACCOUNT card at bottom of Profile tab. Anonymous users see "Create Account" and "Sign In" rows. Signed-in users see their email with a person icon and a "Sign Out" button (red).
- **Onboarding sign-in escape hatch** — "Already have an account? Sign in" link shown on step 0 of OnboardingScreen. Triggers a Modal (`<AuthScreen>`) from App.tsx. After sign-in, `onAuthStateChange` re-checks the onboarding profile and routes the user directly to the main app if they have an existing profile. Solves the "returning user on new device" flow.

### Updated
- **App.tsx** — wrapped with `AuthProvider`; `onAuthStateChange` listener re-fetches onboarding profile on non-anonymous SIGNED_IN events and auto-dismisses the auth modal.
- **supabase.ts** — added `signInWithEmail`, `linkEmailToAnonymous`, `authSignOut` (signs out then restores anonymous session so the app continues to function).

---

## 2026-06-20 — Manual food entry FAB

### New
- **Direct manual entry button** (`NutritionScreen.tsx`, `BarcodeScannerModal.tsx`) — pencil icon FAB added between the barcode and camera buttons; opens the manual entry form immediately without going through the barcode scanner flow. Added `initialStage` prop to `BarcodeScannerModal` so it can open at any stage; resets correctly on each open.

---

## 2026-06-20 — Phase 2: Alpha polish

### New
- **Profile cycle summary card** (`ProfileScreen.tsx`) — shows current phase (coloured dot), day of cycle, and next predicted period date pulled from CycleContext. Shows a prompt to set cycle dates when `isDefaultData` is true.
- **Phase-aware nutrition hint** (`NutritionScreen.tsx`) — purple banner above the daily totals card showing the current cycle phase and its first nutrition tip from `cycleCalculator`. Only shown when real cycle data exists.

### Fixed
- **Notification toggle cancellation** (`NotificationSettingsScreen.tsx`) — turning off a single notification (e.g. pill reminder while period alert stays on) now correctly cancels it. Previous logic only cancelled when all three were off. Fix: cancel-all first, then reschedule whatever is still enabled.
- **MenstruationScreen fetch error** — failed `fetchLogsForMonth` call now shows a tappable amber banner ("Could not load logs. Tap to retry.") instead of silently swallowing the error.
- **NutritionScreen fetch error** — failed `fetchFoodLogsForDate` on mount now shows a tappable error message that retries the load when tapped.

### Verified (no code changes)
- **2.4 Period prediction accuracy** — hormonal contraception path (pill/IUD/implant/injection) correctly collapses ovulatory phase to menstrual→follicular→luteal. `nextPeriodDate` calculation verified correct.
- **2.5 Onboarding → cycle seeding** — already completed in Phase 1.3 (Step 9).

---

## 2026-06-20 — Phase 1.4 / 1.6 / 1.7: Nutrition, barcode, empty states

### Fixed
- **NutritionScreen save-failure feedback** — if `saveFoodLog` returns null, the edit modal closes and an error message is shown instead of silently disappearing.
- **MenstruationScreen phase card hidden when no real data** — phase card is now only rendered when `!isDefaultData`. Previously, new users (before setting cycle dates) saw a phase card driven by defaults, which looked authoritative but was inaccurate.

### Verified (no code changes needed)
- **Barcode scanner flow** — all 5 stages (scanning → looking_up → found → not_found → manual) wired correctly; `scalePer100g` applied to serving size; `onLogged` callback updates Today's Plate list.
- **Nutrition photo log flow** — camera → GPT-4o → editable card → `saveFoodLog` → prepend to list is fully wired; `fetchFoodLogsForDate` on mount restores data across sessions.

---

## 2026-06-20 — Phase 1.2: Period logging end-to-end

### Fixed
- **Logged period dots on calendar** (`src/screens/Menstruation/MenstruationScreen.tsx`) — `fetchLogsForMonth` now called on mount and on every month navigation; days with `flow_level !== 'none'` are overlaid as red dots on the calendar, on top of the phase-tint background. Previously only *estimated* menstrual phase days showed dots; actual logged days were invisible after a session restart.
- **Log sheet state reset** — `openSheet` now resets cramp/mood/flow/notes to defaults each time it opens, so stale values from a previous entry no longer carry over to a new date.
- **Calendar refreshes after save** — `handleSave` calls `loadMonthLogs` after a successful Supabase write so the new dot appears immediately without needing to navigate away.

---

## 2026-06-20 — Phase 1.3: Onboarding cycle seeding

### New
- **Onboarding step 9 — "Your Cycle"** (`src/screens/Onboarding/OnboardingScreen.tsx`) — added as the final onboarding step; stepper UI for last period date, cycle length (21–45 days), period length (1–10 days). On Finish, saves to `cycle_overrides` in parallel with the health profile so `CycleContext` has real data from the very first launch. Eliminates the empty-calendar first-run state.

---

## 2026-06-20 — Phase 1 pre-alpha work

### New
- **Home plate quadrant UI** (`src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.tsx`) — circular SVG donut plate with 4 tappable quadrants (Cycle `#8B3A5A`, Nutrition `#6B5A2D`, Physical `#2D4A6B`, Profile `#9B59B6`). Each tap navigates to the corresponding tab. Header shows time-of-day greeting and current cycle phase badge. Uses `react-native-svg` Path elements with icon/label overlays absolutely positioned over the SVG.
- **Home tab added to TabNavigator** — Home is now the first (default) tab; existing 4 tabs remain unchanged
- **`isDefaultData` flag in CycleContext** — true when no cycle override or logged period data was found; used to prompt first-time users to set their cycle dates
- **Cycle setup prompt in MenstruationScreen** — rose-coloured banner appears when `isDefaultData` is true; tapping navigates to Profile → CycleSettings

### Updated
- **NutritionScreen daily totals** — expanded from calories-only to a full macro summary card showing calories + protein / carbs / fat breakdown
- **`ProfileStackNavigator`** — `OnboardingScreen` now wrapped in `OnboardingWithBack` so it receives `onComplete={() => navigation.goBack()}` when reached via Profile stack (fixes TS prop mismatch)
- **`NotificationService`** — updated `setNotificationHandler` for SDK 53: added `shouldShowBanner` and `shouldShowList` fields (renamed from `shouldShowAlert` in SDK 52)
- **`SubscriptionContext`** — `purchase` interface type changed from `(packageId: string)` to `(pkg: unknown)` to match implementation and PaywallScreen usage

### TypeScript
- All TS errors cleared (0 errors after fixes above)

---

## 2026-06-20 — Onboarding fix + TestFlight build 21

### Bug fix

**Onboarding Finish button not dismissing questionnaire** (commit `4d8284c`)
- After completing all 8 steps and pressing Finish, the profile saved but the screen never closed — user had to force-quit and relaunch to reach the main app
- Root cause: `handleFinish` called `navigation.goBack()`, but `OnboardingScreen` is not on a navigation stack — `App.tsx` renders it conditionally via `showOnboarding` state, so `goBack()` was a no-op
- Fix: removed `useNavigation` from `OnboardingScreen`, added `onComplete` prop; `App.tsx` passes `onComplete={() => setShowOnboarding(false)}` which immediately swaps in `TabNavigator`

---

## 2026-06-20 — First successful TestFlight submission

### EAS build chain fully fixed

**Root cause (found and resolved):** `expo@53.0.27` was installed but all companion packages were still at SDK 52 versions (`react@18`, `react-native@0.76.7`, `expo-router@4.x`). This held `metro` at `0.81.5` when SDK 53 requires `^0.82.0`, killing every EAS build within 78 seconds.

**SDK 53 full upgrade** (commit `20c9679`)
- `react` 18.3.1 → 19.0.0
- `react-native` 0.76.7 → 0.79.6
- `expo-router` 4.0.22 → ~5.1.11
- `metro` now at 0.82.5 (pulled by react-native@0.79.6)
- 12 other expo-\* packages realigned: async-storage, background-fetch, camera, constants, image-picker, linking, notifications, splash-screen, status-bar, task-manager, reanimated, svg
- `@types/react` updated to ~19.0.10, moved from dependencies to devDependencies
- `typescript` pinned to ~5.8.3 in devDependencies
- Removed `@types/react-native` (now bundled with react-native)
- Added `expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude` in package.json to suppress known-acceptable warnings

**Entry point fix** (commit `20c9679`)
- Created `index.js` with `registerRootComponent(App)`
- Changed `"main"` in package.json from `"expo-router/entry"` to `"index.js"`
- App uses `@react-navigation` directly — no `app/` directory exists; expo-router as entry point would crash on launch

**Push notification entitlement fix** (commit `2852ea4`)
- Removed `'expo-notifications'` from plugins in `app.config.js`
- Removed `'remote-notification'` from `UIBackgroundModes` (kept `'fetch'`)
- App uses local scheduled notifications only (no server push). The `expo-notifications` plugin adds `aps-environment: production` to the binary, which Apple rejects if the provisioning profile doesn't have Push Notifications enabled

**iOS SDK 26 compliance** (commits `a632459`, `96091a1`)
- Apple now requires all submissions to be built with iOS SDK 26 (Xcode 26) or later
- Set `"image": "macos-sequoia-15.6-xcode-26.0"` in `eas.json` under `build.production.ios`
- Note: `"latest"` resolves to Xcode 26.4 on macOS Tahoe which has compilation incompatibilities with SDK 53 native modules — use `macos-sequoia-15.6-xcode-26.0` specifically
- Set `ascAppId: "6781960320"` in `eas.json` under `submit.production.ios`

**Build 20 submitted successfully to TestFlight** — version 1.0.0 (build 20), processed by Apple, available in TestFlight at https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/6781960320/testflight/ios

## 2026-06-19 — Full codebase reconstruction (Phases 1–24)

### Reconstructed from session notes

**Core logic (Phase 3)**
- `src/utils/cycleCalculator.ts` — 20/20 tests passing; ovulationDay = cycleLength − 14; hormonal suppression collapses ovulatory phase; 7 suites
- `src/utils/cycleCalendar.ts` — PHASE_COLORS map, generateMarkedDates() for react-native-calendars

**Supabase service (Phase 4)**
- `src/services/supabase.ts` — AsyncStorage-backed session, ensureAnonSession(), saveLog(), fetchLogsForMonth(), saveFoodLog(), fetchFoodLogsForDate(), fetchUserPreferences(), saveNotificationSettings(), saveOnboardingProfile(), fetchOnboardingProfile(), saveCycleOverride(), fetchCycleOverride()
- Tables: menstruation_logs, food_logs, user_preferences, cycle_overrides

**MenstruationScreen (Phase 4–6)**
- Calendar with custom markingType, phase card with day badge and countdown, legend, animated slide-up log sheet, cramp/mood/flow/notes
